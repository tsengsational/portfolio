# Modern E-commerce Platform

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive e-commerce solution that combines modern web technologies with robust backend services to deliver a seamless shopping experience. The platform features real-time inventory management, personalized product recommendations, and an intuitive admin dashboard.

## Key Features

- Real-time inventory tracking
- Personalized product recommendations
- Secure payment processing

## Technical Implementation

The platform is built using a modern tech stack:

- **Frontend**: Vue.js with Composition API
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB for product data
- **Cache**: Redis for session management
- **Cloud**: AWS for hosting and CDN

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was implementing real-time inventory updates across multiple users. We solved this by:

1. Using WebSocket connections for live updates
2. Implementing optimistic UI updates
