developer_bio: |
  I'm a passionate software engineer with over 5 years of experience in full-stack development. My expertise lies in building modern web applications using Vue.js, Node.js, and various cloud technologies.

  Throughout my career, I've worked on diverse projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to real-time collaboration tools. I'm particularly interested in creating intuitive user experiences and writing clean, maintainable code.

  When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open-source projects or sharing my knowledge through technical blog posts and conference talks.

  As an artist, I explore the intersection of technology and traditional art forms. My work primarily focuses on playwriting and digital storytelling, where I combine narrative techniques with interactive elements.

  I've written and produced several plays that have been performed in local theaters, and I'm currently working on a digital art installation that explores the relationship between human emotion and artificial intelligence.

  My artistic practice is deeply influenced by my background in software engineering, allowing me to create unique experiences that bridge the gap between technology and human expression.
